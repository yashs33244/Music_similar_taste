# Music_similar_taste
The project checks the similarity between two users' playlist and gives a similarity percentage.
The project employs an advanced algorithm to assess and quantify the degree of similarity between playlists belonging to two distinct users. It accomplishes this by analyzing a variety of musical attributes and characteristics present in the songs within each playlist, such as danceability, energy, tempo, and more. The outcome is a precise and informative similarity percentage, which provides valuable insights into how closely aligned the musical preferences of the two users are. This innovative approach enables users to gain a deeper understanding of their musical compatibility and discover commonalities within their music taste profiles.
